### Known Issues

> URxvt has issues double-wide font glyph characters (I believe particularly with ambiguous width characters). Related search terms for reference: full-width, double-width, non-monospaced, squished icons)

* for full width support/patches see projects such as: [powerman's wcwidth-icons](https://github.com/powerman/wcwidth-icons) or [blueyed's WIP wcwidth](https://github.com/blueyed/zzz-PKGBUILD-rxvt-unicode-wcwidthcallback)

* there are also some setting changes that can be tried, like the method mentioned by mftrhu in [issue #150 comment][issue-150-comment]
