# Why is this a thing?

The original motivation and rationale for creating this project was to provide patched fonts for a separate Vim plugin project: [VimDevIcons]. The patched font was used in [VimDevIcons] to add glyphs (icons) as labels for files based on the filetype extension or entire path.

This project began as a part of the [VimDevIcons] Repository but soon it became apparent it did not belong tied to the Vim plugin. I thought it may benefit others more as a separate project and allow a wider range of uses. This project started before I knew about Fontconfig provided solution, although a patched font still has some benefits over the Fontconfig.
